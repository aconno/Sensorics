    * the notification must create a new task:

    * intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
    *
    * when you press it. You can use NotificationActivity to check whether the new activity
    * is a root activity (that means no other activity was open earlier) or that some
    * other activity is already open. In the latter case the NotificationActivity will just be
    * closed. The system will restore the previous activity. However, if the application has been
    * closed during upload and you click the notification, a NotificationActivity will
    * be launched as a root activity. It will create and start the main activity and
    * terminate itself.
    *
    * This method may be used to restore the target activity in case the application
    * was closed or is open. It may also be used to recreate an activity history using
    * startActivities(...).
